- **Homepage**: Educational content on food safety and common inspection issues.
- **Search Feature**: Look up restaurants and view their inspection results.
- **Violations Page**: Common violations and tips for restaurants to avoid them.

### 1.2 Wireframes
Create wireframes for the user interface of the web application.

### 1.3 Technology Stack Decision
- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for the API.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

### 1.4 API Design
- `GET /restaurants`: Retrieve restaurant data.
- `GET /violations`: Retrieve common violations and educational content.

### 1.5 Documentation
Start documenting the project, including design decisions, API endpoints, and functionalities.

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Code Repository
Set up a GitHub repository for the project.

### 2.2 Development Environment
Ensure all participants have their environments set up with Node.js, npm or Yarn, and a code editor like VSCode.

## 3. Backend Development
